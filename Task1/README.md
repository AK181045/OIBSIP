# Task 1 – Basic Network Scanning with Nmap 
This task focuses on performing a basic network scan using **Nmap** to identify open ports and 
running services on a target machine. The aim was to understand the host’s exposure and analyze what 
services it is making publicly accessible. --- 
##  Objective 
Use Nmap to scan a target system, detect open ports, document the findings, and interpret the 
significance of each service. --- 
## � Tools Used 
- Nmap (Kali Linux) - VirtualBox virtual environment --- 
## � What I Did 
-- Set up a Kali Linux VM for scanning
-- Performed a full TCP port scan on the target machine
- - Identified open ports and associated services
- - Saved the raw scan output as a text file
-- Documented all steps and results in a PDF report 
--- 
## � Scan Summary 
The Nmap scan revealed two open ports: 
|        Port        | State | Service | 	Notes                        |
| 80/tcp           | open | http      | Indicates a running web server |
| 443/tcp          | open | https   |  Shows an encrypted web service is active |


All other ports were filtered, meaning the host did not respond or the firewall blocked the traffic. --- 
##  Files Included - **scan_results.txt** – Raw terminal output of the Nmap scan   - **nmap_scan_results.pdf** – Step-by-step documentation with screenshots and explanations   - **README.md** – Overview of the task and results  - **TASK-1 DEMO VIDEO** – Video explanation --- 
## � Key Takeaways - Nmap provides clear visibility into a system’s open ports   - Ports 80 and 443 indicate active web services   - Filtered ports point to proper firewall or security configurations   - Network scanning is a crucial starting point for any security assessment
